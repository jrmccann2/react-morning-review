     *
     * Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM when the component has been updated. This is also a good
     * place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a network request
     * may not be necessary if the props have not changed).
     *

     * as specific as possible when making this equality check so that we only cause the side-effect when we absolutely
     * want to. In this case, let's edit it so that we only see the console.log when the length of our "list" array has
     * changed:
